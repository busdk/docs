Open and read the file BUGS.md. Determine which entries in the file are currently active issues by using only the file’s own structure and wording (for example: headings like “Active issues”, explicit status markers, or any “fixed/resolved” notes). For each issue entry, review its current status by checking the repository for evidence such as recent commits, tests, changelog entries, documentation changes, or code paths that correspond to the described behavior. If the issue includes reproduction steps, attempt to reproduce it in a clean, minimal workspace using only the provided steps (or the minimal equivalent if paths/tools differ), and record whether it still reproduces and under what conditions. Use this to decide whether the issue is still active or no longer active.

If an issue is still active, keep it in BUGS.md and add a brief, neutral status note under the issue (e.g. a “Status” or “Review notes” subsection/paragraph) that summarizes what was verified (reproduces/does not reprodreliable symptom, and the immediate next action). If an issue is no longer active (already fixed, cannot reproduce with current code, or clearly obsolete), remove the entire issue entry from BUGS.md (not just mark it), while preserving the surrounding formatting and keeping the document’s tone and structure consistent. Do not add any new issues, and do not mention any roles or identities.

Also produce a short console-style summary in thoutput describing what changed (which issues were kept with a note, and which were removed) and why, but do not print the full contents of BUGS.md.
