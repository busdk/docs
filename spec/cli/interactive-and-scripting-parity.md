# Interactive use and scripting parity

Every command must be usable interactively and non-interactively. Interactive prompts are used when the user omits parameters, enabling a guided experience. Non-interactive flags and arguments must allow full scripting and automation. This includes workflows such as nightly cron-driven bank imports or scripted ledger entries produced by external systems.
