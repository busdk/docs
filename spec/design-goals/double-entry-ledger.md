# Double-entry ledger accounting

Double-entry ledger accounting is a core requirement. The ledger follows double-entry bookkeeping principles: each financial transaction is recorded with equal and opposite debit and credit entries affecting two or more accounts. This provides a built-in checksum, supports accrual-based accounting concepts (including receivables and payables, not only cash), and enforces the accounting equation that underpins reliable statements.
