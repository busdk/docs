# BuSDK Design Spec: Design goals and requirements

BuSDK is built to reflect the “small tools that do one thing well” philosophy of Unix-style composability, where independent programs cooperate through simple, universal interfaces and predictable conventions. ([catb.org](https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) In BuSDK, the universal interface is not a pipe stream but the shared, versioned dataset: CSV resources with stable schemas.

The system is modular from the start. Each major feature area is implemented as an independent, small tool or service that interacts through shared data rather than tight coupling. Ledger, invoicing, tax reporting, bank import, budgeting, and document generation are intended to be independently developed, tested, and deployed in isolation. Modules communicate via the common data repository rather than through direct function calls or internal APIs, increasing robustness, reducing integration risk, and supporting parallel development.

The data format is deliberately plain-text and longevity-oriented. All business and accounting data is stored in CSV using UTF-8 text so that it remains accessible decades into the future without dependence on proprietary software. CSV is expected to remain readable and usable because it is ubiquitous, standardized in practice, and supported across tools and operating systems; guidance on “sustainable formats” emphasizes widespread support and self-describing characteristics as key factors in long-term accessibility. ([TransAccess](https://www.tagovcloud.com/2023/06/what-are-sustainable-formats-for-electronic-records-part-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) BuSDK therefore treats its dataset as a durable business record, not as the private internal state of a single application.

Plain CSV is paired with structured schemas. Each dataset adheres to Frictionless Data’s Table Schema, a JSON-based schema specification for tabular data. Table Schema provides field metadata including names, data types, and constraints, enabling automatic validation and consistent processing across modules while keeping the underlying data easily inspectable and editable. ([Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) This schema-driven approach makes the data self-describing and ensures different modules can agree on the same structure without sharing code.

Git is the canonical, append-only source of truth. The Git repository containing the CSV resources and schemas is treated as the system’s database of record. Every change to any CSV—adding transactions, adding an account, recording an invoice, correcting an error—is captured as a commit that contributes to an immutable history of modifications. The underlying Git model stores objects addressed by cryptographic hashes, with commit objects referencing their parent commits, forming a hash-linked history. ([Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) BuSDK leverages this structure to maintain a tamper-evident audit log of bookkeeping activity, consistent with the accounting requirement that historical records are preserved and corrections are explicit rather than silently destructive.

Double-entry ledger accounting is a core requirement. The ledger follows double-entry bookkeeping principles: each financial transaction is recorded with equal and opposite debit and credit entries affecting two or more accounts. This provides a built-in checksum, supports accrual-based accounting concepts (including receivables and payables, not only cash), and enforces the accounting equation that underpins reliable statements. ([docs.mypocketcfo.com](https://docs.mypocketcfo.com/article/131-accrual-based-accounting-method-and-its-double-entry-ledger-system?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

BuSDK aims to provide comprehensive small-business features through dedicated modules. The initial scope includes a general ledger and chart of accounts; invoicing for sales and purchases with status tracking and linkage to ledger entries; Finnish VAT (ALV) classification and reporting for periods and rates; bank transaction import from common online banking exports with user mapping and categorization; generation of professional PDF invoices, preferably in a long-term archival profile such as PDF/A for sustainability; and budgeting with budget-versus-actual reporting. PDF/A is specifically intended for long-term preservation use cases and is defined as an ISO-standardized profile designed for archives. ([The Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000318.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

The system is CLI-first and human-friendly. Every function is accessible via CLI commands designed to be intuitive and consistent, and suitable for SSH-based work, automation, and future API exposure. Where useful, commands should support machine-readable output formats (CSV or JSON) in addition to human-readable output, enabling scripts and later agentic integrations.

Auditability and append-only discipline are non-negotiable. BuSDK enforces an append-only approach to financial records. Once a transaction is recorded and committed, it is not erased or rewritten; corrections are performed through explicit new entries such as reversals, and metadata changes are tracked through commits. Git history ensures that even manual edits become visible as diffs, but user-facing tools are expected to discourage or disallow destructive edits and to prefer explicit corrective actions.

Extensibility is a first-class goal. The architecture must remain simple enough that a single developer can implement a new module over a weekend using common libraries. The data contracts (CSV + schemas) are the shared interface so that modules can be written in different programming languages and still interoperate. New business capabilities—inventory, payroll, specialized reports—should be addable by defining new datasets and tools without requiring a rewrite of the core.

AI-readiness is a design objective, not a dependency. BuSDK must remain fully functional without AI. At the same time, its structured, standardized dataset is intentionally designed to make AI-assisted classification, reconciliation, and anomaly detection easier and safer, because proposed changes can be represented as patches and reviewed through Git workflows before acceptance. Claims that AI can reduce manual bookkeeping effort through faster categorization and reconciliation reflect current industry positioning and should be treated as optional augmentation.
