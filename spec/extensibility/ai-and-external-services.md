# AI and external service integration

AI integration is treated as an optional module layer. An AI assistant can read repository data to identify anomalies and can propose changes as commits or branches for human review. This creates a reviewable workflow where the user remains in control and AI suggestions become auditable artifacts. Industry narratives emphasize that AI can accelerate bookkeeping by classifying and reconciling transactions quickly; BuSDK’s structured data and Git-based review model is designed to enable this safely rather than implicitly trusting black-box automation.
