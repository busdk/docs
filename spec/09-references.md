# BuSDK Design Spec: References and external foundations

BuSDK’s modular CLI philosophy aligns with the Unix notion of composable tools and clear interfaces, where programs do one thing well and cooperate through simple formats. ([catb.org](https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The sustainability rationale for storing records in widely supported, documented formats is consistent with guidance on sustainable electronic record formats and long-term accessibility. ([TransAccess](https://www.tagovcloud.com/2023/06/what-are-sustainable-formats-for-electronic-records-part-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The tabular schema contract is based on Frictionless Data Table Schema and may optionally employ a Frictionless Data Package manifest to bind repository datasets together. ([Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The archival document preference for invoices is consistent with PDF/A’s long-term preservation purpose and conformance constraints. ([The Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000318.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The tamper-evident audit model relies on Git’s content-addressed object model and parent-linked commit structure, and can be strengthened via shared head anchoring and governance workflows. ([Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Double-entry and accrual-based accounting expectations are grounded in standard bookkeeping practice; BuSDK’s enforcement model assumes balanced entries and supports receivables/payables workflows. ([docs.mypocketcfo.com](https://docs.mypocketcfo.com/article/131-accrual-based-accounting-method-and-its-double-entry-ledger-system?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Optional AI augmentation for transaction classification and reconciliation is treated as a non-required module capability aligned with current industry positioning of AI bookkeeping tools.
