# AI-assisted classification (review before commit)

If AI assistance is present, classification can be suggested automatically, such as identifying that €1240 matches an open invoice and mapping a €10 bank fee to a bank-fees expense account. The user reviews and approves suggestions before commit, keeping control while benefiting from automation. ([Uplinq](https://www.uplinq.com/post/how-ai-bookkeeping-is-revolutionizing-small-business-accounting?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The import results in committed changes, for example with a message like “Import Feb 2026 bank transactions.”
