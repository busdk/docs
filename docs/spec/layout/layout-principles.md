# Data directory layout (principles)

BusDK organizes data in a transparent directory structure at the repository root. The structure is designed for human discoverability while remaining machine-validated through schemas.

For Finnish compliance, the layout MUST support audit-trail review and long-term readability, and it MUST be documented in the repository methods description. See [Finnish bookkeeping and tax-audit compliance](../compliance/fi-bookkeeping-and-tax-audit).
