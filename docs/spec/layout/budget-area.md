# Budgeting area

A budgeting area holds planned budgets in datasets such as `budgets.csv`, where each row typically represents a budgeted amount by account and period using fields like fiscal year, account, period identifier (year-month or quarter), and budget amount. Alternative pivoted formats are possible but less “CSV-friendly” in terms of schema validation and diff behavior, so the row-based form is preferred.
