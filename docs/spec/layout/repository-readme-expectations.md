# Repository-level README expectations

The repository-level README is expected to document structure, workflows, and conventions so that a future user (including the same user years later) can understand how to interpret the dataset and how to operate the tools.

For Finnish compliance, the repository MUST also include a methods description and a list of datasets/materials (luettelo kirjanpidoista ja aineistoista) that explains how the accounting is produced, how datasets relate, and how to access stored evidence. This documentation MUST be versioned within the workspace. See [Finnish bookkeeping and tax-audit compliance](../compliance/fi-bookkeeping-and-tax-audit).
