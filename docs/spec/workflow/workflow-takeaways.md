# Workflow takeaways (transparency, control, automation)

Across this workflow, BusDK emphasizes transparency (CSV plus Git history show exactly what happened, using external Git tooling), control (no silent adjustments; even AI produces reviewable changes), and automation (repeatable commands, integrated document generation, and optional AI-assisted classification). Treating evidence as data and locking periods on close keeps the audit trail intact and ensures that "January stays January."
