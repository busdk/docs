# Initialize a new repository

She begins by creating a dedicated Git repository for the bookkeeping year. The initial step is to scaffold the standard directory layout and schema files (manually or via module-provided init commands), then commit the baseline state using Git directly. This repo becomes the single source of truth for the year: every dataset update and supporting document is tracked as a commit, with Git operations handled outside BusDK.
