# Evolution over time (extending the model)

As the business evolves, BusDK’s data model can extend. International currency support can be introduced by adding a currency field to relevant schemas and records. If Alice hires an assistant, collaboration can happen via shared Git repositories with pull requests and branch protections, using standard Git workflows outside BusDK. If new taxes or reporting obligations appear, new modules can be added without refactoring the core, because the dataset remains the stable interface.
