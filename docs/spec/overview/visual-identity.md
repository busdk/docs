# Visual identity and branding on outputs

BusDK has its own visual identity (name, logo, colors) used to brand BusDK itself: this documentation site, BusDK’s project materials, and BusDK-owned tool surfaces such as CLI help/version output and other BusDK-specific informational screens. The BusDK logo exists as part of the project identity. 

Business documents produced for invoices, reminders, statements, and other customer- or counterparty-facing PDFs/exports represent the user’s business, not BusDK. BusDK must not automatically place a BusDK logo, watermark, or “generated by BusDK” attribution on those documents.

All customer-facing documents must be template-driven and branding-configurable by the workspace. Users may include their own branding (logo, typography, colors, layout) by editing their document templates and providing the referenced assets. BusDK may ship neutral starter templates, but those defaults must remain BusDK-brand-free and intended to be customized for the user’s brand.

BusDK branding is therefore limited to BusDK’s own tools and BusDK’s own documentation artifacts; workspace outputs are branded only by the workspace configuration and templates.
