# CSV conventions

All BusDK data is stored as CSV text files with a header row and one record per row. Conventions prioritize compatibility: UTF-8 encoding; comma delimiters; quoting for fields containing commas or newlines; ISO date formats (YYYY-MM-DD) for date fields; and predictable numeric formats for monetary values. The intended result is that the dataset remains usable in both text editors and common spreadsheet tools, supporting the long-term accessibility goals associated with sustainable formats guidance.
