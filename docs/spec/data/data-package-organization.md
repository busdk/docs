# Data Package organization

BusDK may optionally adopt a Frictionless Data Package (typically a `datapackage.json`) to provide a repository-wide manifest of resources and their schemas. A Data Package descriptor lists resources, their paths, and their schema references, enabling whole-repository validation and standardized publication or interchange patterns. ([specs.frictionlessdata.io](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Even without a descriptor, the directory structure is designed to be discoverable and navigable, but the Data Package option improves automation and interoperability.
