# References and external foundations (summary)

BusDK’s modular CLI philosophy aligns with the Unix notion of composable tools and clear interfaces, where programs do one thing well and cooperate through simple formats. ([catb.org](https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The sustainability rationale for storing records in widely supported, documented formats is consistent with guidance on sustainable electronic record formats and long-term accessibility. ([TransAccess](https://www.tagovcloud.com/2023/06/what-are-sustainable-formats-for-electronic-records-part-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The tabular schema contract is based on Frictionless Data Table Schema and may optionally employ a Frictionless Data Package manifest to bind repository datasets together. ([Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The archival document preference for invoices is consistent with PDF/A’s long-term preservation purpose and conformance constraints. ([The Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000318.shtml?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The tamper-evident audit model relies on Git’s content-addressed object model and parent-linked commit structure, and can be strengthened via shared head anchoring and governance workflows. ([Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Double-entry and accrual-based accounting expectations are grounded in standard bookkeeping practice; BusDK’s enforcement model assumes balanced entries and supports receivables/payables workflows. ([docs.mypocketcfo.com](https://docs.mypocketcfo.com/article/131-accrual-based-accounting-method-and-its-double-entry-ledger-system?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Optional AI augmentation for transaction classification and reconciliation is treated as a non-required module capability aligned with current industry positioning of AI bookkeeping tools.
