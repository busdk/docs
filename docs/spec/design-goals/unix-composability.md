# Unix-style composability (micro-tools)

BuSDK is built to reflect the “small tools that do one thing well” philosophy of Unix-style composability, where independent programs cooperate through simple, universal interfaces and predictable conventions. ([catb.org](https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) In BuSDK, the universal interface is not a pipe stream but the shared, versioned dataset: CSV resources with stable schemas.
