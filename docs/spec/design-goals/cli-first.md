# CLI-first and human-friendly interfaces

The system is CLI-first and human-friendly. Every function is accessible via CLI commands designed to be intuitive and consistent, and suitable for SSH-based work, automation, and future API exposure. Where useful, commands should support machine-readable output formats (CSV or JSON) in addition to human-readable output, enabling scripts and later agentic integrations.
