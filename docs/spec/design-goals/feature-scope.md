# Initial feature scope (modules)

BuSDK aims to provide comprehensive small-business features through dedicated modules. The initial scope includes a general ledger and chart of accounts; invoicing for sales and purchases with status tracking and linkage to ledger entries; Finnish VAT (ALV) classification and reporting for periods and rates; bank transaction import from common online banking exports with user mapping and categorization; generation of professional PDF invoices, preferably in a long-term archival profile such as PDF/A for sustainability; and budgeting with budget-versus-actual reporting. PDF/A is specifically intended for long-term preservation use cases and is defined as an ISO-standardized profile designed for archives.
