The initial scope includes a general ledger and chart of accounts; invoicing for sales and purchases with status tracking and linkage to ledger entries; Finnish VAT (ALV) classification and reporting for periods and rates; bank transaction import from common online banking exports with user mapping and categorization; generation of professional invoice documents (PDF); and budgeting with budget-versus-actual reporting.
