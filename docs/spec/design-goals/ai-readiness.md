# AI-readiness (objective, not dependency)

AI-readiness is a design objective, not a dependency. BusDK must remain fully functional without AI. At the same time, its structured, standardized dataset is intentionally designed to make AI-assisted classification, reconciliation, and anomaly detection easier and safer, because proposed changes can be represented as patches and reviewed through Git workflows before acceptance. Claims that AI can reduce manual bookkeeping effort through faster categorization and reconciliation reflect current industry positioning and should be treated as optional augmentation.
