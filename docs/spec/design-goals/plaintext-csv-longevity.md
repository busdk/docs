# Plain-text CSV for longevity

The data format is deliberately plain-text and longevity-oriented. All business and accounting data is stored in CSV using UTF-8 text so that it remains accessible decades into the future without dependence on proprietary software. CSV is expected to remain readable and usable because it is ubiquitous, standardized in practice, and supported across tools and operating systems; guidance on “sustainable formats” emphasizes widespread support and self-describing characteristics as key factors in long-term accessibility. ([TransAccess](https://www.tagovcloud.com/2023/06/what-are-sustainable-formats-for-electronic-records-part-1/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) BusDK therefore treats its dataset as a durable business record, not as the private internal state of a single application.
