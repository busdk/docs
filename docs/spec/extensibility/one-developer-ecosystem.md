## One-developer contributions and ecosystem

BusDK lowers the barrier for user-written extensions. A user can write small scripts or commands to produce specialized reports such as accounts receivable aging, using only the workspace datasets and schemas. In the preferred default layout those datasets are stored as CSV alongside their schemas, but the key property is that the data contract remains explicit and readable with general-purpose tooling. This encourages an ecosystem of shareable custom modules and report scripts, similar in spirit to communities around CLI-based accounting tools.
