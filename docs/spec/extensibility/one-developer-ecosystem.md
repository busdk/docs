# One-developer contributions and ecosystem

BusDK lowers the barrier for user-written extensions. A user can write small scripts or commands to produce specialized reports such as accounts receivable aging, using only the CSV files and schemas. This encourages an ecosystem of shareable custom modules and report scripts, similar in spirit to communities around CLI-based accounting tools.
