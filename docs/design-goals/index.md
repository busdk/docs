## BusDK Design Spec: Design goals and requirements

This section is split into **single-concept** documents:

[AI-readiness (objective, not dependency)](./ai-readiness), [Auditability and append-only discipline](./append-only-auditability), [CLI-first and human-friendly interfaces](./cli-first), and [Deterministic `.bus` command files](./deterministic-busfiles) define core execution principles.

[Double-entry ledger accounting](./double-entry-ledger), [Extensibility as a first-class goal](./extensibility), [Initial feature scope (modules)](./feature-scope), and [Git as the canonical, append-only source of truth](./git-as-source-of-truth) define scope and architecture constraints.

[Modularity as a first-class requirement](./modularity), [Plain-text CSV for longevity](./plaintext-csv-longevity), [Schema-driven data contract (Frictionless Table Schema)](./schema-contract), and [Unix-style composability (micro-tools)](./unix-composability) define data and integration properties.
