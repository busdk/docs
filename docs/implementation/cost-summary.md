title: Bus project cost summary
description: Snapshot of total commits and AI-related spend across the BusDK org (2025-02-15), with per-module breakdown and average cost per commit.
---

## Overview

This page summarizes project cost metrics captured on **2025-02-15 at approximately 19:00 Europe/Helsinki (EET, UTC+02:00)**. The numbers are intended as a snapshot for comparing relative effort and spend across repositories.

**Total commits** across the BusDK org repositories are used as a proxy for work units. **Total cost** is the sum of AI-related spend attributed per repository or module (documentation, code, and tooling). Commits were mostly produced via automated AI-driven commit workflows, so commits are intended to be small and semantically meaningful; that makes the metric useful for comparing relative effort across modules.

All amounts are in **USD**. Totals may not exactly match the sum of per-module rounded values because of rounding; the stated totals below are authoritative.

### Totals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Total commits** | 1,005 |
| **Total cost** | **654.63 USD** |
| **Approximate average cost per commit** | **0.65 USD** |
