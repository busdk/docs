## BusDK Design Spec: Implementation and development status

This section covers how modules are structured and their current implementation state:

- [Module repository structure and dependency rules](./module-repository-structure)
- [Developer module workflow](./developer-module-workflow): scaffold modules, run commit/work/spec/e2e, set agent and run-config (Cursor, Gemini, Claude, Codex)
- [Development status](./development-status): implementation state of each BusDK module and the Bus as a whole, derived from each repository’s PLAN.md
- [Regulated report PDFs (TASE and tuloslaskelma)](./regulated-report-pdfs): design for producing Finnish balance sheet and income statement as PDF from BusDK
- [Bus project cost summary](./cost-summary): snapshot of total commits and AI-related spend per module (2025-02-15)
- [Module source access and pricing](./fsl-modules): modules offered under source-available licenses (e.g. FSL) with cost-based pricing and foundational cost allocation
