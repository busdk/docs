## External system integration patterns

External systems can integrate by exchanging CSV resources or by operating on the Git repository itself. Examples include a web store exporting daily sales as CSV for invoice import, or a CRM integration that triggers creation of customer records via external Git commits or webhook-driven automation. The design aims to prevent vendor lock-in by relying on open, widely supported formats.
