## Map a bank account to a ledger account

Define which chart of accounts entry represents this bank account for postings.

Owner: [bus bank](../../modules/bus-bank).

Map the bank account to a ledger account so cash movement can be posted systematically. The mapping is the bridge between statement data and the chart of accounts.
