## `ledger_account_id` (ledger mapping)

`ledger_account_id` maps the bank account to exactly one ledger account in the chart of accounts, such as a bank or cash account. Bookkeeping uses this mapping to make posting bank movements systematic and to keep reconciliation and exports consistent.

This is a reference to [`ledger_account_id` in the chart of accounts](../chart-of-accounts/ledger-account-id).

Example values: `acc-1910`, `acc-1930`.
