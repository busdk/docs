## `bic` (bank account BIC)

`bic` identifies the bank and branch for the bank account. Bookkeeping uses it as supporting identifier information, especially in payment and matching workflows and in exports that require bank identification.

Keeping BIC explicit improves reviewability when bank details appear on invoices or payment instructions.

Example values: `BANKFIHH`, `NDEAFIHH`.
