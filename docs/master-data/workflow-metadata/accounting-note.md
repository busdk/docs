## `accounting_note` (exception explanation)

`accounting_note` is a free-text explanation for booking decisions that are not obvious from the evidence alone. Notes reduce future rework during audits, VAT filings, and year-end close because they preserve the rationale behind exceptions.

A good note captures what was unusual and how it was handled, such as a private portion, a partial deduction, or a settlement batch that needed a manual split.

Example values: `Split: 60% business, 40% private.`, `Reverse charge — EU supplier.`.
