## Lock an item

Prevent further edits once a period is closed or an item is finalized.

Owner: [bus invoices](../../modules/bus-invoices).

Locking prevents accidental edits after a period is closed or a filing is prepared. A locked item should remain readable and exportable, but changes should require an explicit correction workflow.
