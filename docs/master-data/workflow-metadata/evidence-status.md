## `evidence_status` (evidence completeness signal)

`evidence_status` expresses whether the required evidence files are present and acceptable for booking, such as missing, ok, or needs_review. It prevents accidentally booking items without proper attachments and supports a clean checklist before VAT filings and year-end work.

Evidence status does not replace evidence itself. It is the workflow signal that tells a reviewer whether the record is safe to book from an audit-completeness perspective.

Example values: `missing`, `ok`.
