## Classify a purchase invoice

Create the posting intent split across accounts and VAT treatment decisions.

Owner: [bus invoices](../../modules/bus-invoices).

Classify purchases by recording the intended posting split and VAT handling. This captures the decision in structured form so automation becomes validation and review rather than ad hoc spreadsheets.
