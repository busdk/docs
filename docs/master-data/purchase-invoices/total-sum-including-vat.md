## `total_sum_including_vat` (invoice total, gross)

`total_sum_including_vat` is the gross total for the purchase invoice. Bookkeeping uses gross totals to match bank payments and to validate that net and VAT totals reconcile to the paid amount when the invoice is settled in full.

Explicit gross totals help reconciliation and reduce manual “is this the same invoice?” checks during review.

Example values: `1255.00`, `99.08`.
