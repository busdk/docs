## `duedate` (due date)

`duedate` records when the purchase invoice is due for payment. Bookkeeping uses it for payables scheduling and for review context when cash movement timing differs from invoice periods.

Due date is not the posting date, but it helps explain why payments occur when they do.

Example values: `2026-02-20`, `2026-03-10`.
