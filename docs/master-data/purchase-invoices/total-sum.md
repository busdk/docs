## `total_sum` (invoice total, net)

`total_sum` is the net total for the purchase invoice. Bookkeeping uses header totals for validation and review, including consistency checks between the invoice evidence, the posting specification, and the bank payment.

Having totals explicit on the header supports quick review without opening the PDF for every item.

Example values: `1000.00`, `79.90`.
