## Prepare purchase invoice postings

Turn purchase intent into a balanced posting proposal for the journal.

Owner: [bus invoices](../../modules/bus-invoices).

Preparing postings turns the purchase posting specification into a balanced proposal for the journal. This makes the journal append-only while still allowing purchase workflows to evolve.
