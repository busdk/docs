## `description` (review aid)

`description` explains the intent of a purchase posting line, especially when the invoice is split across multiple accounts. Bookkeeping uses descriptions to make review possible without opening the PDF for every line.

Clear descriptions also preserve context for later audits and year-end work, where the reason for a split posting might otherwise be forgotten.

Example values: `Office rent, Feb 2026`, `Laptop purchase`.
