## `dimension` (lightweight reporting tag)

`dimension` is a lightweight tag used for internal grouping such as project or cost center. On the purchase side, tagging at the posting line level provides precise reporting without fragmenting the purchase invoice object itself.

Keeping dimension simple supports year-end analysis and internal reporting without introducing a complex dimension subsystem.

Example values: `Office`, `Project Alpha`.
