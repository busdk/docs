## `asset_class_hint` (asset class hint)

`asset_class_hint` is a short hint describing what kind of asset a capitalizable line represents, such as software, computer, license, or leasehold improvement. Bookkeeping uses it to keep later depreciation and asset classification work consistent without rereading the invoice evidence.

Hints are not authoritative categories. They are reviewable signals that reduce future ambiguity.

Example values: `computer`, `software`.
