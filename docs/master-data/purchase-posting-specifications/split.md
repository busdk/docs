## Split a purchase across accounts

Record multi-line intent so expenses and assets are posted to the correct accounts.

Owner: [bus invoices](../../modules/bus-invoices).

Split purchases across accounts when one vendor invoice contains multiple cost types or a mix of expenses and assets. The split is the bookkeeping intent that makes later postings auditable.
