## Register an evidence document

Add the evidence file and its metadata so bookkeeping can retrieve it deterministically.

Owner: [bus attachments](../../modules/bus-attachments).

Register evidence so it can be retrieved deterministically during review and audits. Evidence metadata keeps attachments searchable by period, counterparty, and role.
