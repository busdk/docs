## Review evidence completeness

Mark evidence status so items are not booked without acceptable attachments.

Owner: [bus attachments](../../modules/bus-attachments).

Review evidence completeness before booking and filing. This keeps missing attachments visible early and avoids booking items that cannot be supported later.
