## Link evidence to a record

Attach evidence to an invoice or bank transaction so audit navigation is one step.

Owner: [bus attachments](../../modules/bus-attachments).

Link evidence to the invoice or bank transaction it supports so audit navigation is one step from posting to file. The bookkeeping requirement is that you can always traverse from booked entries back to evidence.
