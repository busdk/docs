## `service_end_date` (service period end)

`service_end_date` records when the invoiced service period ends. Together with `service_start_date`, it makes the service period explicit so bookkeeping can allocate revenue across periods consistently and keep the allocation reviewable.

Example values: `2026-02-28`, `2026-12-31`.
