## `duedate` (due date)

`duedate` records when payment is expected for the sales invoice. Bookkeeping uses it for receivables aging, reminders, and cash-flow explanations.

Due date is not the posting date, but it is important context during review because it explains why cash movement may differ from the invoicing period.

Example values: `2026-02-15`, `2026-03-01`.
