## `date` (invoice date)

`date` is the sales invoice date. Bookkeeping uses it as the primary anchor date for period selection in ordinary revenue recognition workflows and for VAT reporting logic.

When invoice date is explicit, period-based reports and completeness checks can be run without opening PDFs, and reviews can be performed consistently across months.

Example values: `2026-02-01`, `2026-02-15`.
