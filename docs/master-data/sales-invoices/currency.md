## `currency` (invoice currency)

`currency` is the sales invoice currency. Even when most invoices are in EUR, explicit currency prevents silent assumptions and keeps exports and reviews consistent when exceptions occur.

Bookkeeping relies on explicit currency to interpret amounts correctly and to keep reporting and reconciliation safe as the business encounters foreign-currency activity.

Example values: `EUR`, `SEK`.
