## Prepare sales invoice postings

Turn invoice intent into a balanced posting proposal for the journal.

Owner: [bus invoices](../../modules/bus-invoices).

Preparing postings turns invoice line intent into a balanced proposal for the journal. This separates classification work (done at invoice/row level) from journal posting and period controls.
