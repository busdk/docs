## `description` (what was sold)

`description` explains what the invoice row represents. Bookkeeping and audits rely on clear descriptions because they reduce the need to open PDFs during review and help explain exceptions later.

Good line descriptions make row-level posting intent understandable even when the counterparty or product naming conventions change over time.

Example values: `Monthly hosting, Feb 2026`, `Consulting services`.
