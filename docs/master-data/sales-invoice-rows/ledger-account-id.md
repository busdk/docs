## `ledger_account_id` (income account intent)

`ledger_account_id` records which income account the invoice row belongs to. An income account per sales line is one of the highest-value fields for automation because it turns sales bookkeeping from manual classification into validation and review.

Example values: `acc-3000`, `acc-3010`.
