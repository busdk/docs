## `invoice_id` (parent invoice link)

`invoice_id` links a sales invoice row to its parent invoice. Bookkeeping uses this link so row-level posting intent can always be reviewed in the invoice context, including counterparty, dates, totals, and linked evidence.

Example values: `SI-2026-000123`, `SI-2026-000124`.
