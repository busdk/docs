## `dimension` (lightweight reporting tag)

`dimension` is a lightweight tag used for internal grouping such as project, cost center, or product area. Bookkeeping uses it to support reporting and year-end analysis without introducing a full dimension subsystem.

When kept simple and consistent, a single dimension field is often enough for small-business needs while still enabling meaningful breakdowns.

Example values: `Project Alpha`, `Operations`.
