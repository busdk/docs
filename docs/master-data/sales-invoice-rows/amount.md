## `amount` (quantity)

`amount` is the quantity for the invoice row. Bookkeeping uses quantity as part of the commercial evidence and for validation of invoice totals and VAT calculations.

Explicit quantities make anomaly detection and review easier, especially when unit prices and discounts vary.

Example values: `1`, `10`.
