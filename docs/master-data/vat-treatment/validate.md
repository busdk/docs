## Validate VAT mappings

Check that VAT rates, treatment codes, and reporting expectations align with datasets.

Owner: [bus vat](../../modules/bus-vat).

Validate VAT mappings before reporting and filing. The goal is that invoice VAT, treatment codes, and reporting cadence are consistent enough that the VAT report can be produced without manual spreadsheet repair.
