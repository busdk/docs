## `vat_deductible_percent` (purchase-side deductibility)

`vat_deductible_percent` expresses how much of the input VAT is deductible for the purchase. Not all VAT is deductible in all contexts, and deductibility can be partial.

When deductibility is recorded where you decide the posting, bookkeeping can compute the deductible portion consistently, separate non-deductible parts deterministically, and keep the decision reviewable later without spreadsheet work.

Example values: `100`, `0`.
