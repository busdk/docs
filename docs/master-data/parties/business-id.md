## `business_id` (strong national identifier)

`business_id` is a strong identifier for a legal entity, such as a Finnish Y-tunnus. Bookkeeping uses it to reduce duplicates and to match counterparties consistently across invoices, bank transactions, and documents.

When a strong identifier is present, reports and audits remain cleaner because the counterparty can be identified unambiguously even when names vary.

Example values: `1234567-8`, `9876543-2`.
