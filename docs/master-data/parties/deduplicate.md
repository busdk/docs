## Deduplicate parties

Merge duplicates so reports and audits refer to one legal entity consistently.

Owner: [bus entities](../../modules/bus-entities).

Deduplicate parties when the same legal entity exists multiple times due to naming variations or imports. Bookkeeping benefits because reports and audits then refer to one counterparty consistently.
