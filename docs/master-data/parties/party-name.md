## `party_name` (counterparty label)

`party_name` is the primary human-facing identifier for a counterparty. Bookkeeping uses it in review, matching, and audit trails, and it remains valuable even when other identifiers are missing or inconsistent.

Names also matter for bank transaction matching when references are missing or noisy, because counterparty names can be the strongest remaining signal.

Example values: `Acme Oy`, `Example Supplier AB`.
