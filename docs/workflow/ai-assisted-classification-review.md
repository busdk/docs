## AI-assisted classification (review before external commit)

If AI assistance is present, classification can be suggested automatically, such as identifying that €1240 matches an open invoice and mapping a €10 bank fee to a bank-fees expense account. The user reviews and approves suggestions before external commit, keeping control while benefiting from automation. The import results in reviewable updates to the repository data that are committed via external Git tooling, for example with a message like “Import Feb 2026 bank transactions.”
