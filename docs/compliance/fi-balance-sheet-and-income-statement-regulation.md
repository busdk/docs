title: Finnish balance sheet and income statement regulation
description: Practical KPL, KPA, PMA, and IFRS application for balance sheet and income statement content, presentation, disclosures, and filing timelines.

## Overview

In Finland, balance sheet and income statement obligations are layered. The Accounting Act (KPL) defines the core financial-statement structure, general accounting principles, the true and fair view requirement, comparative information, and preparation, signing, and filing principles. Presentation layouts then depend on entity size: small and micro entities follow Government Decree 1753/2015 (PMA), while other entities follow the Accounting Decree 1339/1997 (KPA).

The IFRS framework is relevant especially for listed entities and consolidated accounts through IAS Regulation 1606/2002. These rules do not remove the KPL core requirement that statements must provide a true and fair view. If layout-only presentation is insufficient, the missing information must be provided in notes.

## Source hierarchy and scope

At EU level, IFRS application and the accounting-directive framework set the upper layer. At national level, KPL is the base law and PMA/KPA define practical statement structure. Finnish Accounting Board (KILA) guidance and statements refine interpretation where statutes leave application choices.

The key scope split is entity size (micro/small/medium/large) and whether the entity is a public-interest entity (PIE). These categories determine reporting breadth and whether additional statements, such as a cash flow statement, are mandatory.

## Mandatory content and layout

The minimum financial statement package includes the balance sheet, income statement, and notes. A cash flow statement is required for large entities and PIEs. Comparative figures are generally required for the prior period, and they are adjusted when presentation structure changes where practical.

Small-entity balance sheet and income statement layouts are prepared under PMA annex formats. Micro entities have presentation simplifications, including broader line aggregation, but simplifications do not override the true and fair view standard. If a transaction is material, minimum-line presentation alone is insufficient without additional breakdown or note disclosure.

For medium and large entities, statement layouts follow KPA. In practice, this means the layout difference by size class is not cosmetic; it is part of the legal information level.

## Measurement, accruals, and presentation principles

KPL general principles govern substance even when a line item is formally presented. Materiality allows deviation for immaterial matters, but the basis for deviation must be disclosed in notes. If mechanical application of a rule would materially undermine a true and fair view, the deviation must be justified in notes.

Impairments and valuation choices directly affect both statements. A permanent value decline in non-current assets or investments is recognized as an expense and cannot be deferred without a supported assessment. Fair-value use is allowed in limited situations and then follows IFRS-linked technical presentation requirements.

Financial statements are presented in Finnish or Swedish and in euros. If additional currency values are shown, the applied conversion rate is disclosed in notes.

## Notes as statement completion

Notes are not optional add-ons; they are a mandatory part of the financial statement that completes balance-sheet and income-statement meaning. Small-entity note requirements are defined in PMA chapter 3. Core areas include preparation principles, exceptional income and expenses, material post-period events, off-balance-sheet commitments, and related-party transactions.

In practice, notes should be tied directly to statement lines that would otherwise be ambiguous. This reduces interpretation risk in audit, authority review, and registry filing.

## Process, deadlines, and sanctions

Financial statements and the annual report are prepared within four months after period end. The statements are dated and signed under KPL. For entities with filing obligations, registration is made in the Trade Register, and for limited liability companies and cooperatives late filing triggers staggered late fees under Trade Register Act 564/2023.

Operationally, deadline risk is managed through three anchors: preparation within four months, company-law approval in its own timetable, and filing by month eight to avoid late fees.

## Common failure patterns

The most common presentation error is over-aggregation of layout lines without materiality analysis and note completion. Another recurring issue is missing disclosure for exceptional items. A third is inconsistent long-term versus short-term classification of receivables and liabilities, which distorts liquidity reading. A fourth risk is delayed impairment recognition without a defensible basis.

These four points are also the most frequent quality issues from the perspective of audit, registry handling, and management accountability.
