title: Finnish closing adjustments and evidence controls
description: Adjustment categories and evidence controls required for Finnish closing quality, including accruals, depreciation, impairment, provisions, and note support.
---

## Overview

This page defines adjustment categories and evidence controls that are typically required before final Finnish financial statements are produced. It does not restate filing deadlines or UI design requirements.

## Adjustment categories

Accrual adjustments align revenue and expenses to period substance through accrued income, accrued expenses, and prepayments. These entries are required to preserve a true and fair view when cash timing differs from delivery timing.

Depreciation and impairment controls align fixed-asset carrying values with plan-based depreciation and value-loss evidence. Inventory controls align ending inventory value with cost/realizable-value logic and documented count support.

Provision controls capture probable future obligations tied to current or earlier periods where recognition criteria are met. Receivable-loss controls require case-based support for collectability deterioration before loss recognition.

Payroll and employer-liability accrual controls ensure earned-but-unpaid payroll costs and related charges are recognized in the correct period.

Tax closing controls include current tax accruals and, where applicable, deferred-tax analysis from temporary differences with explicit documentation of recognition policy.

## Evidence and traceability controls

Each material adjustment must have support that is reviewable without ambiguity. In practice this means voucher-level support for postings and calculation-level support for note disclosures and estimate-based entries.

Traceability must remain continuous from source event to statement line, and from statement line back to source evidence, including note disclosures where those notes complete true-and-fair-view obligations.

Closing quality requires that this evidence remains available for audit, authority review, and long-term retention obligations under Finnish bookkeeping requirements.

## BusDK execution mapping

In BusDK workflows, these controls are represented as repository data and append-only postings in journal and related datasets, plus report and disclosure artifacts generated from the closed boundary. Use [Year-end close (closing entries)](../workflow/year-end-close) for command sequence and [Finnish closing deadlines and legal milestones](./fi-closing-deadlines-and-legal-milestones) for statutory timing anchors.
