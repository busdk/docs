description: Statutory timeline and governance checkpoints for closing, signing, approving, and filing Finnish financial statements.

## Overview

This page defines the legal deadline path for Finnish year-end closing and financial statement governance. It focuses on sequence, timing, and mandatory milestones, not accounting adjustments or workflow mechanics.

## Core statutory timeline

For entities under Finnish Accounting Act practice, financial statements (and annual report where required) must be prepared within four months after financial year end. The statement package is dated and signed according to company form requirements.

In limited liability companies (Oy), the ordinary general meeting is held within six months from financial year end. That meeting confirms the financial statements and decides profit distribution.

Trade Register filing timing depends on company form. For Oy and cooperatives, practical filing guidance is anchored to confirmation at general meeting and an eight-month outer limit from year end, with late-filing fees if missed.

## Statement form requirements

Financial statements are presented in Finnish or Swedish and in euros. If additional currency values are shown, conversion basis is disclosed.

The statement package is valid only when the evidence chain remains traceable from business event to voucher to journal entry to ledger to statement, including note disclosures where needed for true and fair view completion.

## Operational milestone anchors

In practice, close governance should treat these as hard anchors:

1. `t + 4 months`: financial statement prepared, dated, and signed.
2. `t + 6 months` (Oy): ordinary general meeting and statement confirmation.
3. `t + 8 months` (Oy/cooperative typical filing path): Trade Register filing deadline to avoid late-fee exposure.
