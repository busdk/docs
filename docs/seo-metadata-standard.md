## Per-page SEO metadata standard

Effective per-page SEO starts from what the page actually is and does, not from site-wide boilerplate. The HTML title and meta description should be derived directly from the page’s primary purpose, the main query intent it satisfies, the H1 and first-screen content, the key differentiators stated on the page, and the most concrete proof points available. Proof points include features, constraints, audience, location, timeframe, or other specifics that the page explicitly states. Metadata must be unique per URL and must not promise anything the page does not deliver. If the page does not mention pricing, do not put pricing in the description. If the page is documentation for one module only, the title and description should reflect that module and that use case, not the whole product.

A practical workflow is to read the page, then extract three to five “truths”: what it is, who it is for, what problem it solves, the strongest differentiator, and any important qualifier. From those truths, select the primary keyword phrase that naturally matches the page’s own wording and intent. That phrase should appear in the page’s headings or opening copy. Then draft a title and a description that reflect those truths. The title should lead with the most specific, intent-matching concept. The description should complete the thought in one or two sentences, staying within the facts stated on the page. Keyword placement should be early but natural; forcing a keyword into the first word often hurts readability and can look like stuffing. Use the brand name when it helps clarity or when the page is a primary entry point (for example a homepage or a main product page); omit or de-emphasize the brand on deep documentation or feature pages where the topic is the draw. Tone should be clear, human, and non-clickbait. Page-specific modifiers such as city, product variant, use case, or target industry belong in metadata only when the page content supports them.

Length guidance is secondary to accuracy. Titles are often truncated in search results by pixel width (roughly 50–60 characters in many layouts), and meta descriptions around 155–160 characters are commonly shown, but exact cutoffs vary by device and layout. Google may also rewrite titles and descriptions. To improve the chance that your metadata survives rewrites, keep it accurate, specific, and aligned with on-page headings and copy. Front-load the most important information so that even a truncated title or description still sets correct expectations. Avoid trailing filler like “learn more” or “click here”; if the snippet is cut, the last visible part should still be substantive.

When using templates at scale, define which parts must be unique per page and which can be templated safely. The unique parts are the primary topic, the main differentiator for that URL, and any qualifier that distinguishes this page from sibling pages. Safe template parts might include a shared brand suffix or a common phrase that applies to all pages in a section. For similar or near-duplicate pages, differentiate by intent and unique attributes: one page might be “Install on Linux” and another “Install on macOS,” each with a description that states the platform and the steps the page actually covers. Avoid reusing the same description across multiple URLs; that weakens relevance and can trigger duplicate-content concerns.

Special cases deserve explicit rules. Paginated category pages should include the page number or range only when the content clearly is “page 2 of 5”; the title and description should still describe the category and what the user will find on that page. Thin pages (little substantive content) should have metadata that matches what is there; do not inflate with claims the page does not support. Pages with dynamic filters (for example “all results where X”) work best when the metadata reflects the default or most representative state, or when the page has a stable, filter-independent purpose. Multi-language pages need unique metadata per language, translated or adapted so that the title and description sound natural and match the language of the page content. For pages where the primary content is a tool, documentation, or a pricing table, the title should name the tool or doc set or “Pricing” and the description should state what the user can do (run a calculator, read API docs, compare plans) and any scope (which product, which version) that the page actually covers.

Example one: a documentation page that explains the `bus budget` CLI. The page states that the command records budgets and runs budget vs actual reports, maintains datasets keyed by account and period, and produces variance outputs from journal data. A strong title is “bus budget — record budgets and run budget vs actual reports.” The description could be: “CLI reference for bus budget: maintain budget datasets by account and period, add or set amounts, and emit budget vs actual variance from journal data.” This works because the title matches the H1 and the Name line, the description reflects only what the page documents (commands and scope), and there are no unsupported claims.

Example two: a Software Design Document for the bus-accounts module. The page states that the module maintains the chart of accounts as schema-validated repository data and enforces uniqueness and allowed account types. A strong title is “bus-accounts — Software Design Document.” The description could be: “Design spec for the BusDK accounts module: chart of accounts as schema-validated repository data, CLI for init, list, add, validate, and stable references for downstream modules.” This works because the title identifies the document type, the description summarizes the module’s role and the concrete capabilities listed on the page, and the brand appears once in a supporting role.

Example three: a 404 page. The page explains that the requested page was not found and offers links to the index and the documentation home. A strong title is “Page not found.” The description could be: “The requested documentation page was not found. Links to the BusDK documentation index and home.” This works because the title is short and accurate, the description sets expectations and directs the user without promising content that does not exist.

Common per-page mistakes include using generic titles such as “Home” or “Services” that could apply to many pages, repeating the same description across multiple URLs, stuffing keywords in a way that reads unnaturally, adding claims the page does not support (for example “best in class” when the page never says that), and forgetting critical qualifiers (for example implying all platforms when the page covers only one). A simple QA method is to review page by page: check that the title and description are unique for that URL, that they match the primary intent of the page, that they align with the H1 and first-screen copy, and that the snippet would accurately set expectations for someone who clicks through. If the snippet overpromises or describes a different page, revise the metadata to reflect what the page actually delivers.

In this documentation site, per-page metadata is set in each page’s YAML front matter as `title` and `description`. Site-wide defaults are in the repository’s _config.yml; front matter overrides them for jekyll-seo-tag. When adding or editing a page, apply this standard so the snippet stays unique, accurate, and aligned with the page content.
