When this docs project is part of a superproject, each module’s source code is available as a sibling directory `../bus-{NAME}` relative to the docs project root (for example `../bus-accounts`, `../bus-dev`). Those directories contain the module’s unit tests, e2e tests, and `README.md` and `PLAN.md`; use them when documenting module behavior, development state, or test evidence on this page.

Introduce each workflow on this page only by name and a link to an inner workflow page that describes that workflow. Do not inline the workflow description, e2e details, or runtime behavior here; keep that content on the linked workflow page. If you add a new workflow and no inner workflow page exists yet, create that inner page first (or add a dedicated subsection to an existing workflow page), then link to it from this page. This page should show only the workflow name/link and the module readiness table for each workflow.

When you are asked to do something new with this page or to change how it works, update this rule file (development-status.mdc) as part of the same change: add or adjust the requirements above so that the MDC continues to reflect the current expectations for this page. New structural rules, section patterns, or constraints must be codified here so that future edits stay consistent without re-deriving the requirements.
