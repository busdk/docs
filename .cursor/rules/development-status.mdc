When this docs project is part of a superproject, each module’s source code is available as a sibling directory `../bus-{NAME}` relative to the docs project root (for example `../bus-accounts`, `../bus-dev`). Those directories contain the module’s unit tests, e2e tests, and `README.md` and `PLAN.md`; use them when documenting module behavior, development state, or test evidence on this page.

This page must start with a **Use cases index** after the opening paragraph. The index lists each use case with: (1) an internal link to the use case section on this page (e.g. `#accounting-workflow`), (2) a link to the canonical use case document (workflow or compliance page), and (3) a one-sentence description of the journey value. Include an entry for **Orphan modules** linking to the orphan section. Each use case section has a heading, then a link to the canonical document, then optionally a short paragraph, then a **module readiness table** with columns: Module (label without `bus-` prefix, linked to the module end-user doc), Readiness (percent from 0/10/20/…/100 plus compact journey status), Biggest next, Biggest blocker. Any bus module mentioned in a table cell must be an inline link to that module's page. Table readiness values must match each module page's "Use case readiness" lines.

Introduce each workflow on this page only by name and a link to an inner workflow page that describes that workflow. Do not inline the workflow description, e2e details, or runtime behavior here; keep that content on the linked workflow page. If you add a new workflow and no inner workflow page exists yet, create that inner page first (or add a dedicated subsection to an existing workflow page), then link to it from this page. This page should show only the workflow name/link and the module readiness table for each workflow.

When you are asked to do something new with this page or to change how it works, update this rule file (development-status.mdc) as part of the same change: add or adjust the requirements above so that the MDC continues to reflect the current expectations for this page. New structural rules, section patterns, or constraints must be codified here so that future edits stay consistent without re-deriving the requirements.
