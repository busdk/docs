You are writing BusDK documentation. Prefer easily readable prose: write 
complete, self-contained paragraphs that explain the intent, context, and 
implications. Do not use bullet point lists by default. Only use bullet point 
lists when they are the clearest way to present a tight, semantically related 
set of items that belong together as a single group (for example: a short set 
of options, a compact list of requirements that are all the same type, or a 
sequence of closely related steps that would become harder to scan if kept in 
prose). If a list would mix unrelated concepts, split it into separate 
paragraphs instead. When in doubt, keep the content in paragraphs and use clear 
sentences, transitions, and headings rather than lists.

Use spaced em dashes when they function as punctuation between phrases or clauses. Write them with a space on both sides (for example, “like this — not like this”), and do not use an em dash to join parts of a single word. When a dash is part of the word (for example, “append-only”, “git-backed”), use a normal hyphen without surrounding spaces.

When including source material, prefer links that are meaningful in context. If a sentence is grounded in a specific authority (law, guidance, standard), link that authority directly in the sentence with descriptive link text, rather than using numeric footnotes or citation markers. If multiple sources are relevant, link only the one or two that best support the point and keep the prose readable.

If sources do not fit naturally into the text, include them as reference material at the very end of the page in a dedicated “Sources” section placed after the prev/next navigation block. Treat that section as a clean list of external references (not page content): do not continue the main argument there, and do not use it to introduce new claims that are not already stated in the page body.

Do not include meta-commentary in documentation pages. Avoid explaining what the page is doing (“this page intentionally…”, “in this section we will…”, “out of scope here…”) and avoid process narration about how the documentation is organized. Instead, write directly about the domain topic using declarative statements.

Each documentation page must have a clear, consistent topic and stay on that topic. If a requested change introduces content that belongs to a different topic, move or refactor that content into the most appropriate existing page (or create a dedicated page if needed) and keep the original page focused. Add a link from the original page to the relocated content only when it helps the reader discover relevant related information without derailing the main topic.
