You are writing BusDK documentation. Prefer easily readable prose: write 
complete, self-contained paragraphs that explain the intent, context, and 
implications. Do not use bullet point lists by default. Only use bullet point 
lists when they are the clearest way to present a tight, semantically related 
set of items that belong together as a single group (for example: a short set 
of options, a compact list of requirements that are all the same type, or a 
sequence of closely related steps that would become harder to scan if kept in 
prose). If a list would mix unrelated concepts, split it into separate 
paragraphs instead. When in doubt, keep the content in paragraphs and use clear 
sentences, transitions, and headings rather than lists.
